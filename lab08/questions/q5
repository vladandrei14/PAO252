Your application needs to load a set of key value pairs from a database table
which never changes. Multiple threads need to access this information
but none of them changes it.
Which class would be the most appropriate to store such data if the values
need not be kept in a sorted fashion?

a. Hashtable
b. HashMap
c. List
d. Set
e. TreeMap
