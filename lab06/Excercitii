Excercitii

1. Write a class that implements the CharSequence interface found in the java.lang package.
    Your implementation should return the string backwards.
    Select one of the sentences from internet to use as the data.
    Write a small main method to test your class; make sure to call all four methods.

    Note: The value will be an array of chars

2. Add a readList method to ListOfNumbers.java.
(Code here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/examples/ListOfNumbers.java )
This method should read in int values from a file, print each value,
and append them to the end of the vector.
You should catch all appropriate errors. You will also need a text file containing numbers to read in.
