1. Create a Java application which will:
    - Connect to a Database Server using the JDBC API: use lab09/ddl/pao252_employees.sql
        to create the necessary table
    - Create 2 threads that will insert data in the DB.
        The id will be a counter that both threads need to increment concurrently
            and the other fields could be random strings.
        Make use of ExecutorService to invoke the threads
    - Create a 3rd thread (or use the main one) to retrieve all entries in the DB
        after the previous threads ran
